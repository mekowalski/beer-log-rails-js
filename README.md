# Kowalski, are you there?

Rails-Javascript Layer
- Testing Rails-Javascript layer repository

- I ran `rake db:migrate`
- New server, beer application has no collection of Beers, BeerStyles or Companies
(meaning app still works as brand new)

- I didn't get to really utilize JS for this app
- Would like to integrate the Rails-Javascript part for this app
